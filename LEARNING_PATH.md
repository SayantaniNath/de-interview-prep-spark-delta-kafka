### AWS ClinicalFlow — Healthcare Data Lakehouse: Architecture Spec
*Dataset: **Synthea** synthetic EHR — 100K patients × 10 years → ~50–100M records across patients, encounters, conditions, medications, observations. FHIR R4 JSON format. No credentialing needed; code can be pushed to GitHub.*
*Why healthcare: HIPAA/GDPR/PHI/PII compliance is a top differentiator for healthcare DE roles and appears in senior architect JDs across all verticals.*

**Services demonstrated:** S3 + KMS, Glue (Crawler + ETL + Data Catalog), EMR Serverless, Redshift Serverless, Lambda, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Firehose, MWAA, Apache Iceberg, CloudTrail, CloudWatch

**Compliance layer demonstrated:** HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification, PHI encryption at rest + in transit, GDPR right to erasure (Iceberg DELETE + VACUUM), consent tracking, audit logging, column-level + row-level access control

#### Data Flow

**Batch path:**
```
Synthea generator → FHIR R4 JSON bundles (PHI: names, DOBs, SSNs, diagnoses, medications)
  → S3 raw zone (KMS encrypted at rest, bucket policy: deny non-SSL)
  → ydata-profiling: HTML profile report (null rates, distributions, record counts per year) — informs ETL design
  → Glue Crawler → Data Catalog (FHIR resource types as tables: Patient, Encounter, Condition, MedicationRequest, Observation)
  → Glue ETL — de-identification step (HIPAA Safe Harbor: mask 18 identifiers):
       patient_name → SHA-256 token | DOB → age bucket (0-17, 18-64, 65+) | zip → 3-digit prefix | SSN → NULL
  → Great Expectations: validate silver (no SSN regex match, no exact DOB, null % on token fields < 1%) — fails job if PHI leaks
  → S3 silver (de-identified, Apache Iceberg format)  ← covers Hudi/Iceberg/Delta tri-fecta
  → dim_patient_consent table: consent given/withdrawn per data use category + effective dates (GDPR)
  → Redshift COPY → fact_encounters, fact_conditions, dim_patient (token only), dim_medication (gold layer)
  → Redshift column privileges: analysts see patient_token only; PHI role sees full dim (restricted)
  → EMR Serverless: 10-year readmission risk aggregation (heavy join across 50M+ rows, terminates after)
```

**Streaming path:**
```
Python producer (replays PaySim CSV at ~1K events/sec as JSON)
  → Kinesis Data Streams
  → Lambda (validate schema, add fraud_flag via threshold rule, enrich with category)
  → Kinesis Firehose → S3 (streaming prefix, hourly partitions)
  → Glue ETL incremental job picks up new S3 partitions
```

**Orchestration:**
```
MWAA DAG:
  S3KeySensor (new raw file) → trigger Glue Crawler → GlueJobOperator (ETL)
  → RedshiftDataOperator (COPY) → data quality check (row count, null %) → CloudWatch alarm on SLA breach
```
*Develop + test on local Airflow (same DAG). Deploy to MWAA for 1–2 demo sessions, then delete environment to avoid $0.49/hr cost.*

#### Build Phases

**Phase 1 — Batch (Jun 23 – Jul 4, Tue/Thu slot freed from Maarek + Fri slot):**
- Run Synthea: `./run_synthea -p 100000 --years 10` → FHIR R4 JSON + CSV exports (~10GB raw, ~50–100M records)
- S3 bucket: raw/ (KMS encrypted, deny non-SSL policy), silver/ (de-identified), gold/, audit/ prefixes
- **ydata-profiling** (Session 1, ~30 min): profile Synthea CSVs → null rates, age distributions, encounter counts per year → HTML report to S3 → informs de-identification design
- Glue Crawler on FHIR JSON → Data Catalog (Patient, Encounter, Condition, MedicationRequest, Observation tables)
- Glue ETL — **HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification step** (Session 2, ~1.5 hr): SHA-256 token for patient_id/name, DOB → age bucket (0-17 / 18-64 / 65+), zip → 3-digit prefix, SSN → NULL, free-text notes → scrubbed
- **Great Expectations** (Session 3, ~1 hr): silver suite — no SSN regex match, no exact DOB column, null % on patient_token < 1%, encounter row count within ±5% of expected → Data Docs HTML to S3; fails Glue job on breach
- `dim_patient_consent`: GDPR consent tracking (consent_category, given_at, withdrawn_at, legal_basis)
- Redshift Serverless: COPY → fact_encounters, fact_conditions, dim_patient (token + age_bucket only), dim_medication
- Redshift column-level privileges: `analyst` role sees patient_token only; `phi_authorized` role sees full dim_patient
- CloudTrail enabled: all S3 GET + Redshift query audit → stored in separate audit/ S3 bucket (immutable)
- EMR Serverless: 10-year readmission risk aggregation across 50M+ rows (1 job, terminate after)

**Phase 2 — Orchestration (Aug 1–11, parallel to Airflow 4B):**
- Build DAG locally first (Airflow), then deploy same DAG to MWAA
- Add CloudWatch alarm: if Redshift row count < expected, fire SNS alert
- Tear down MWAA environment after demo to stop hourly billing

**Phase 3 — Streaming (Aug 11–18, parallel to CDC Pipeline):**
- Python Kinesis producer: stream PaySim rows as JSON events
- Lambda handler: schema validation + fraud_flag enrichment + Firehose delivery
- End-to-end test: event → S3 within 60 seconds, Glue picks up within next hourly window

#### Failure Scenarios (built into Phase 1 and 2 — deliberately break and recover each)

| Service | Failure to inject | How to detect | How to recover (prod pattern) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Glue ETL** | Schema mismatch: add new column to raw S3 file without updating script | Job fails with `AnalysisException` | Enable `mergeSchema` in Glue or add schema evolution handling; use `enableUpdateCatalog` flag |
| **Glue ETL** | Job bookmark drift: reprocess already-seen files | Duplicate rows in silver layer | Reset job bookmark via console; add dedup step on unique key in ETL |
| **Glue Crawler** | Partition not detected after new S3 prefix added | Athena/Redshift Spectrum returns no data | Run `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` or re-trigger crawler; automate with S3 event → Lambda → trigger crawler |
| **Redshift COPY** | S3 IAM role missing `s3:GetObject` on new prefix | `COPY` hangs then fails with `S3ServiceException` | Check `STL_LOAD_ERRORS` table; fix IAM policy or bucket policy; re-run COPY with `MAXERROR` to surface all bad rows |
| **Redshift COPY** | Data type mismatch (varchar too short) | Row-level error in `STL_LOAD_ERRORS` | Inspect error table: `SELECT * FROM STL_LOAD_ERRORS ORDER BY starttime DESC LIMIT 10`; widen column, COPY again |
| **EMR Serverless** | Executor OOM on large shuffle (no salting) | Stage fails, Driver log: `GC overhead limit exceeded` | Increase executor memory config; add repartition before wide transformation; or salt the join key |
| **EMR Serverless** | Spot interruption mid-job | Job fails unexpectedly | Enable checkpointing for Spark jobs; use On-Demand fallback in instance fleet config |
| **Lambda** | Timeout on large Kinesis batch | CloudWatch shows `Task timed out` after 3s | Increase timeout + memory; reduce batch size in Kinesis event source mapping; add DLQ for failed batches |
| **Lambda** | At-least-once delivery causes duplicates in S3 | Duplicate files in Firehose prefix | Make Lambda idempotent: hash event + check S3 object exists before writing; use Firehose deduplication window |
| **Kinesis** | Shard iterator expired (consumer fell behind) | `ExpiredIteratorException` in Lambda logs | Scale shards (`UpdateShardCount`); tune Lambda batch size + parallelization factor; check `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds` CloudWatch metric |
| **MWAA / Airflow** | Glue job fails mid-DAG, downstream tasks run anyway | Wrong data in Redshift | Set `trigger_rule=TriggerRule.ALL_SUCCESS` on downstream tasks; add `GlueJobSensor` with failure callback |
| **MWAA / Airflow** | Zombie task (task stuck in `running` state) | Scheduler heartbeat loss, task never completes | Kill via `airflow tasks clear`; set `task_instance_mutation_hook` timeout; configure `scheduler.zombie_task_threshold` |
| **S3** | Object deleted mid-Glue ETL run | Glue fails with `NoSuchKey` | Enable S3 Versioning; add retry logic in ETL script; use Glue job bookmarks to reprocess from last checkpoint |
| **Iceberg** | Concurrent write conflict (two Glue jobs writing same table) | `CommitFailedException` | Iceberg uses optimistic concurrency — conflicting writer retries automatically (up to `write.upsert.enabled`); avoid concurrent writes to same partition by serializing via MWAA task dependency |
| **Great Expectations** | Expectation suite fails on new upstream data (schema drift adds new category) | GE raises `ValidationError`, Glue job exits non-zero | Update expectation suite: add new value to `expect_column_values_to_be_in_set`; add `expect_column_to_exist` checks to catch schema drift early; version suites in S3 alongside data |

#### Cost Controls
| Service | Cost estimate | Action |
|---|---|---|
| S3 | Free (<5 GB) | — |
| Glue ETL (2 DPU, ~5 min/run) | ~$0.07/run | Run sparingly during dev |
| EMR Serverless (1 job) | ~$0.10–0.20 | Terminate immediately after job |
| Redshift Serverless | ~$0.36/RPU-hr | Auto-pause enabled; query only during active work |
| Lambda + Kinesis | Free tier for test volumes | — |
| MWAA | $0.49/hr × ~72 hrs | Spin up Phase 2 week only, delete after (~$35 total) |
| **Total estimate** | **~$50–70** | Acceptable for full AWS DE portfolio project |

#### Interview story
*"Built a HIPAA-compliant clinical data lakehouse on AWS: Synthea synthetic EHR data (100K patients, 10 years, ~50M records). Raw FHIR JSON lands encrypted in S3 (KMS). Glue ETL applies HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification — token, age bucket, zip prefix — before writing Iceberg silver. Great Expectations validates no PHI leaks downstream. Redshift gold layer with column-level privileges: analysts see tokens only, PHI-authorized roles see full records. CloudTrail audit log on all S3 and Redshift access. GDPR right to erasure handled via Iceberg DELETE + VACUUM. MWAA orchestrates the full batch DAG; Kinesis + Lambda handles real-time encounter event streaming."*

### Snowflake Mini-Project (embedded in 4C slot, Sep 1–14)
*Same PaySim data. 3 sessions (Tue/Thu), no schedule extension needed.*

| Topic | Status |
|---|---|
| Snowpipe: auto-ingest from S3 event notification → Snowflake staging table | ⏳ |
| Streams + Tasks: CDC-style incremental processing (staging → curated table) | ⏳ |
| BI layer: analytical views + virtual warehouse sizing + query profile exercise | ⏳ |

*Interview story: "Set up Snowpipe to auto-ingest from S3, used Streams + Tasks for CDC-style incremental processing — direct comparison to Kinesis+Lambda (push) vs Snowpipe (poll/event) patterns."*

---

**Resume note:** FinFlow is framed as a *fintech transactions pipeline* (PaySim synthetic payments data, NOT crypto). Repoint code from crypto JSONL → PaySim before any resume submission that names FinFlow as a payments/transactions project.

## PILLAR 8: Behavioral
*Interview round: Behavioral (Round 6) | Start: Aug 2026 — do NOT start early, stories get stale*

| Story | Status |
|---|---|
| Most complex data project — end-to-end ownership, trade-offs, measurable outcomes | ⏳ |
| Major optimization — latency / cost / reliability improvement with numbers | ⏳ |
| Conflict with a coworker + resolution | ⏳ |
| Decision made with incomplete information | ⏳ |
| Raised quality bar on a project | ⏳ |
| Why Databricks — must include real product opinion (Delta vs Iceberg, Photon, Unity Catalog model) | ⏳ |
| Databricks vs Snowflake vs BigQuery — architecture-level differentiation | ⏳ |
| Mistake owned + what changed afterward | ⏳ |
